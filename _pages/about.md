Hi! Iâ€™m Prakhar. I'm a PhD student under [Prof Golnoosh Farnadi](https://gfarnadi.github.io/) at [McGill](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/). I graduated from [NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"}, with a Masters of Computing (AI specialization) under [Prof. Reza Shokri](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~reza/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to that, I did my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Delhi](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} and worked at [Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore](https://adsc.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"} as a Research Engineer for two years. My research interests involve studying the challenges that arise in machine learning when moving from the sandbox to the real world, including multiplicity, fairness, privacy, adversarial robustness, compression, etc., by uncovering the learning dynamics. My long-term goal is a career in research and academia in the field of AI.


<sub>**Speaker Bio (Long):** Prakhar is a PhD student under Prof Golnoosh Farnadi at McGill University and Mila. His research spans several aspects of multiplicity with an emphasis on fairness, and has been recognized with the Best Paper Award at FAccT 2023 and a spotlight presentation at AFME@NeurIPS 2024. He is a recipient of the prestigious FRQNT Doctoral Training Scholarship Award, the McGill Graduate Excellence Award, and the Mila Excellence Scholarship for EDI in research. Prakhar is also actively involved in teaching, and has organized a tutorial for FAccT 2025, helped design the curriculum for Indigenous Pathfinders in AI at Mila, and served as a TA for the AI4Good summer school at Mila in addition to several university courses at McGill. He is a program committee member of NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, FAccT, ARR, AAAI, AISTATS, WACV, and has been a volunteer for FAccT 2024, ICLR 2025, and FAccT 2025.</sub>
